<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Lasagne are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian
  dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as rag√π, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices, like
  Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.
</p>
<p>
  The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other
  ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, shallot, and prosciutto until onion is translucent and
    prosciutto releases some fat, about 10 minutes. Add pork and beef; season with 1 teaspoon nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt to taste. Cook and
    stir over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pour red wine over meat mixture; increase heat and cook until wine evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and mix well; bring to a
    boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and flavors of Bolognese sauce have combined, 1
    1/2 to 2 hours.
