<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  A salad is a dish consisting of mixed, mostly natural ingredients with at least one raw ingredient. They are often dressed, and typically
  served at room temperature or chilled, though some can be served warm.
</p>
<p>
  Garden salads use a base of leafy greens such as lettuce, arugula/rocket, kale or spinach; they are common enough that the word salad
  alone often refers specifically to garden salads. Other types include bean salad, tuna salad, fattoush, Greek salad (vegetable-based, but
  without leafy greens), Israeli salad and sōmen salad (a noodle-based salad).
